  "date": "2024-03-31",
  "content": "The Lenovo Legion Go, touted by some as the Switch's big brother and the next \"Steam Deck killer,\" faces hurdles in its Windows-based software and lackluster battery life. Lenovo's unrefined front-end, coupled with the innate limitations of Windows, don't make for a very console-like experience. <br><br> Many of these issues, however, can be solved by Linux. Particularly Bazzite, a SteamOS-based distro, offers both a console-like interface and increased fine-tuning over power consumption. This makes for a much better overall experience.",
