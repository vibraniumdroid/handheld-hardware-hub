This is something we take very seriously. We met with engineers from the factory that manufactured the springs, to conduct a concentrated analysis. A root cause was found, and was resolved quickly. In order to provide the excellent customer service that Retroid is known for, we are providing a two-year warranty on the triggers, for any order shipped before January 30, 2024. If a problem should arise with the triggers on your system, please do not hesitate to contact Customer Support. We will ship replacement triggers directly to you at no additional cost. Thank you for your continued support! -Team Retroid\" <br><br> As always, Retroid's commitment to customer service stands out in the SBC Handheld market.
