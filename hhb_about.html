    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>My inspirations</h3>
    <p>
        I see myself as an all-around tech enthusiast, and most of my passions and pastimes relate, in some way, to computer hardware or software. One particular area of interest for me is handheld gaming. Mainstream handhelds primarily consist of devices such as the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck, but there exists a wealth of more niche devices tailored to specific purposes, needs, tastes, and use cases in the handheld gaming community.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a collector of handhelds, I often find myself searching up the specifications of various such devices. I’ve noticed that these searches often take me to obscure sites: someone’s blog, an article about the device, and, occasionally, the manufacturer’s website. When searching for cellphone specifications, however, the experience is quite different, as there exist numerous sites that effectively consolidate and organize all relevant smartphone specifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        A website of this sort but designed for the convenient presentation of handheld specifications would be quite useful. My searches have led me to no site that has done this, and I am inclined to believe that this is due to the rather small size of the community. Regardless, I am confident that such a site, if populated with entries for a sufficient number of devices, would ultimately prove to be useful to members of the handheld gaming community. Thus, I have pursued this project.
